## Description:
Our project is Stuy's very first Dating App! Stuy kids are forever busy cluttering their minds about exams and grades,and in doing so they often forget one of the most pure aspects of life: love. As such, we have taken on our civic responsibility to ensure Stuy students keep their hearts as plentiful as their brains through Stuymble. As a state-of-the-art dating app, Stuymble allows users to input relevant information about themselves, including their age, location (borough), interests, gender, and height into its secure records. Taking into account user-reported preferences regarding future soulmates, Stuymbleâ€™s advanced matching algorithm takes on the role of Cupid, effectively pairing individuals with flawless compatibility and spreading love throughout every corner of Stuyvesant High School.
